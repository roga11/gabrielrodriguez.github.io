**[MSTest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MSTest/index.html) - _R package_**  
with Jean-Marie Dufour
>This package implements hypothesis testing procedures that can be used to identify the number of regimes in a Markov-Switching model. It includes the methods proposed in Hansen (1992), Carrasco et al. (2014), Dufour & Luger (2017), and Rodriguez-Rondon & Dufour (2024). 

**[mbreaks v2.0](https://github.com/roga11/mbreaks) - _R package_**  
with Linh Nguyen, Pierre Perron, \& Yohei Yamamoto
>This package implements the efficient dynamic programming approach to conduct estimation and testing for linear models in presence of structural breaks in the mean and variance as described in Bai & Perron (1998) and Perron, Yamamoto, & Zhou (2020). 

**[bootBtest](https://github.com/roga11/bootBtest) - _R package_**  
>This package allows the user to perform the bootstrap pre-test procedure described in Davidson & MacKinnon (2000) to determine an appropriate number of bootstrap simulations to use to minimize loss of power resulting from sampling. 

**[MaxMC](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/MaxMC/index.html) - _R package_**  
with Julien Neves \& Jean-Marie Dufour
>An implementation of the Monte Carlo techniques described in details by Dufour (2006) and Dufour and Khalaf (2007). The two main features available are the Monte Carlo method with tie-breaker, mc(), for discrete statistics, and the Maximized Monte Carlo, mmc(), for statistics with nuisance parameters.
