with Jean-Marie Dufour
>This package implements hypothesis testing procedures that can be used to identify the number of regimes in a Markov-Switching model. It includes the methods proposed in Hansen (1992), Carrasco et al. (2014), Dufour & Luger (2017), Kasahara & Shimotsu (2018) and Rodriguez-Rondon & Dufour (2023).
